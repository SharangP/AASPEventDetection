The IEEE AASP Challenge addresses the problem of acoustic event detection and classification in an office environment. Our system performs segmentation and event classification on a continuous stream of acoustic activity in an office using basic feature extraction techniques and a single layer frame-by-frame classifier. We achieve high classification accuracy in noiseless environments, but performance severely deteriorates in noisy environments.
