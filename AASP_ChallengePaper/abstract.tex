The IEEE AASP Challenge addresses the problem of acoustic event detection and classification in an office environment. Our system performs segmentation and event classification on a continuous stream of acoustic activity in an office using basic feature extraction techniques and a two layer classifier (we haven't implemented two layers yet).
