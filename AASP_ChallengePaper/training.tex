The classification stage of our system employs two levels of classification. As input
the classifier takes in an event signal and first classifies what type of event it is.
Then based upon the type of event the signal is passed through a type-specific 
classifier which determines the exact event contained in the signal. In the second stage
each type has its own classifier.

Each level of classification in the system was trained with features extracted from the 
provided training data. The first stage classifier was trained using the full set of 
extracted features for all events. The second stage classifiers were each trained using 
features extracted only from training signals of the correct type. Additionally, the 
features used for training were chosen to best describe the type of event being classified.
