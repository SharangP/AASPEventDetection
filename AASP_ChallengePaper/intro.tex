The task of event detection and classification is fundamentally important in computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). Detecting events such as words in a sentence of speech, the arrival of a bus or train, or any other common occurrence in an audio stream is the first step of any speech or audio processing system that needs to make use of this information. Many such systems then need to classify the detected events in order to take appropriate actions.

In this project submission, the problem of event detection and classification, as applied to an office environment, was approached from a pattern recognition perspective. Our system consists of a segmentation stage, a feature extraction stage, and two classification stages. The first stage detects the onset and offset of events in a live recording, the second extracts features from each event that can be used to classify events, and the final stages classify each detected event
using two pre-trained classifiers. The classification system initially classifies the detected event as one of a few groups of events. The system then classifies the events in each group as a specific type of event using a set of features that extracts the most discriminatory information from the events within each group.
