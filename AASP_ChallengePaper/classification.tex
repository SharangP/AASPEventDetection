After a set of event signals has been segmented, the classifier extracts a full set of 
features for each event signal. For each event, these features are passed into the first
level classifier. Based upon the output of the first stage classifier, each event is 
labeled with its subgroup.

Each event signal was then passed through the classifier that corresponds to its subgroup 
label and reclassified based upon the subset of features that best describes its type of
event. 

Types were chosen such that members of a given type generally have many similar features. 
The set of features that is used to determine the specific event that occurred in stage two
is the set which varies most among the members.
