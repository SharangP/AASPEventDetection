In a k-folds sense, our classification system performed well. This implies that our system
is not deficient in features that accurately classify events in this challenge. 

The major challenges that hindered the performance of our classification were noise in the 
development set and the problem of segmenting the input file into individual events. The 
noise also posed a major challenge in segmenting the file.
