The classification system proposed in this submission performs well in low noise conditions without the problem of segmentation. However, the problem of event detection in a noisy environment is difficult, as can be seen by the rapid degradation of the system's performance.

The major challenges that hindered the performance of our classification were noise in the development set and the problem of segmenting the input file into individual events. The noise also posed a major challenge in segmenting the file
