Before events within an input signal can be classified, the segments of the input which contain events 
muse be extracted. This is done by examining the short time energy and spectral centroid features. 
The segmenter examines peaks of the features and checks them against a threshold to determine the onset and 
offset of events in the signal. The onset and offset times are then used to extract the portions
of the input which contain an event. Extracted portions are then passed to the classification
stage.
