Things we should try:

GENERAL:

adaBoost to choose # & which features
longer windows with overlap (20-100 ms)
reduce dimensionality using PCA
different features may need different window lengths, center at event

SEGMENTATION:

using 6 features: loudness, spectral centroid, spectral sparsity, temporal sparsity, transient index, harmonicity

thresholding STFT


CLASSIFICATION:

Two levels of HMMS:
    1. decide on # of HMMS using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), group events into clusters of similar things
    2. once the cluster is chosen using the first HMM layer, decide on the specific event by passing through another set of HMMs, which operate on features specific to each cluster.
